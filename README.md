## Duct designing

My first task was to design and manufacture a duct to meet the battery cooling requirements. After performing rough calculations with the help of my seniors, we selected a centrifugal air fan. Considering manufacturing facilities and space constraints, we decided to use sheet metal as the material.

## Body panel designing



Designing the body panels was the most challenging part for me. I learned many techniques related to surface modeling. While working on this, I had to consider space constraints, ensuring that the panels fit precisely with the chassis.

### Manufacturing Stage

I used carbon fiber as the material and utilized the vacuum infusion manufacturing technique.
